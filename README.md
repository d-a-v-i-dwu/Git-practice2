# How to upload a repository that's created locally

Create the file, and create a new empty repository on Github


Use "git init" to turn your folder into a repository


Use "git add ." to add all files in the repository to be tracked


Use "git commit -m """ where after -m it's quotation marks containing your commit message


Go on your online repository and copy the HTTP link


Use "git remote add origin " where after origin you paste the HTTP link


For the first push, use "git push -u origin master" to set the upstream


Afterwards, for all pushes you can just use "git push"
